BlockBuzzNYC is a native Android app that leverages the power of JetPack Compose and Firebase to provide users with an interactive, real-time social mapping experience. Users can create and discover location-based pins, engage in live discussions, manage their profiles, and track achievements.

## Features

- **Create Pins**: Users can mark locations on the map with titles and descriptions, sharing their discoveries with the community.
- **Real-time Chat**: Each pin features a live chat where users can discuss and share information about the location in real-time.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized profiles with the ability to upload photos, view created pins, and track achievements.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can find pins by tags using an intuitive search feature.
- **Location Services**: The map centers on the user's current location, providing a personalized experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JetPack Compose
- **Backend**: Firebase
  - Authentication
  - Realtime Database
  - Storage for profile pictures
- **Location Services**: Integrated with Android's native location API.
  
## Future Additions

The following features are on the roadmap to be added to BlockBuzzNYC, aimed at enhancing user engagement and app functionality:

- **Notification System**: 
  - Implementing a notification system to alert users when their pins receive a significant number of likes or when they unlock new achievements.

- **Advanced Search Capabilities**:
  - Enhancing the search functionality to allow for location-based searches, enabling users to find pins not just by tags but also by proximity to their current or a specified location.

- **Community Moderation**:
  - Introducing a feature for users to request the deletion of pins that may be inappropriate or incorrect, thereby maintaining the quality and accuracy of the information shared within the app community.

- **Customized Pin Assets**:
  - Creating customized pin assets based on the tags given to pins, allowing greater ease of use directly from map screen.
  
These features are intended to create a more dynamic and interactive user experience, and we welcome feedback and suggestions from the community as we continue to develop and improve BlockBuzzNYC.
